**Why did i make it?**
I created a unit converter that is aesthically pleasing and has a user-friendly UI unlike many other unit converter websites, including the google version.

**What did i learn?**
I learnt about dynamic manipulation in JS by using DOM & event listeners. For example, when the user changes the input field, it automatically 
converts the number and changes the output field, without needing to press a button. I also used objects for each quantity to perform the unit conversion with less lines of code.
